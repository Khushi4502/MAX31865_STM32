**MAX31865 Temperature Sensor with STM32L051C8Tx (SPI Communication)**\
This repository contains the code and documentation for interfacing the MAX31865 temperature sensor IC with the STM32L051C8Tx microcontroller using the SPI protocol. The MAX31865 is designed for precise RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) measurements and supports 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire RTDs. This project showcases how to read temperature data from an RTD connected to the MAX31865 and process it using the STM32 microcontroller.  

**Features**  
Interfacing the MAX31865 temperature sensor via SPI.  
Configuring the STM32L051C8Tx SPI peripheral for seamless communication.  
Reading temperature data and converting it to degrees Celsius.  
Example code demonstrating initialization and data acquisition.  

**Hardware Connections**\
The STM32L051C8Tx pinout diagram attached to this repository helps illustrate the pin mappings required for this project. Below are the key pin connections for the SPI interface:  
| MAX31865 Pin  | STM32 Pin | Function  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| SDO (MISO)  | PA6  | 	SPI1_MISO  |
| SDI (MOSI)  | PA7  | SPI1_MOSI  |
| SCLK  | PA5  | SPI1_SCK  |
| CS  | PA8  | Chip Select (SPI_CS)  |
| GND  | GND  | Ground  |

**SPI Overview**  
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol commonly used for communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices like sensors, displays, and storage devices.  

**Key SPI Components:**
Master and Slave: The STM32L051C8Tx acts as the master, while the MAX31865 functions as the slave.  
SCK (Serial Clock): Generated by the master (STM32 on PA5), synchronizing data transfer.  
MISO (Master In Slave Out): Data from the MAX31865 to the STM32 (connected to PA6).  
MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Data from the STM32 to the MAX31865 (connected to PA7).  
CS (Chip Select): Used to select the MAX31865 device for communication (connected to PA8).
